        "The Pathfinder Project was built with a goal in mind: to test the performance index of the React JS framework relative to project scalability. Understanding that React is performance driven and it's useState functionality executes in real time, I decided to work on a project that stretches out it's re-rendering capability.",
      text2:
        "This project makes use of 2 of the best path algorithms: (Djikstra's and A-Star). The algorithm constitutes the use of a Euclidean distance which enables us to measure the distance in a 2 Dimensional system using cartesian co-ordinates. You are greeted with a start node and an end node, of which a node is a square grid. Clicking and dragging would mark a node as visited, and it's display enables testing for the useState functionality.",
      text3:
        "The really interesting thing about the project is the ability to test out the various elements of React and visually stretch the limits of it's rendering ability, and indeed it does prove to be a very efficient framework in providing quality Front-End visuals. We can further say that as far as other scalable projects which have more complexity, React will serve as a powerful tool to ensure quality web apps.",

It was exciting to see how the product evolved and improved with each update during this short time.",
