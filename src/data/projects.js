The algorithm constitutes the use of a Euclidean distance which enables us to measure the distance in a 2 Dimensional system using cartesian co-ordinates. You are greeted with a start node and an end node, of which a node is a square grid. Clicking and dragging would mark a node as visited, and it's display enables testing for the useState functionality.",

        "The really interesting thing about the project is the ability to test out the various elements of React and visually stretch the limits of it's rendering ability, and indeed it does prove to be a very efficient framework in providing quality Front-End visuals. We can further say that as far as other scalable projects which have more complexity, React will serve as a powerful tool to ensure quality web apps.",
